%description
Gamma (Î“) is a lightweight text editor. It is meant to be an alternative to Gedit or Notepad++.
Although the current implementation is tested on linux under Gnome desktop environment,
Gamma can run on Linux, Windows, and Mac if dependencies are installed
(see Dependencies section below).
Gamma uses GTK3 (cross-platform GUI toolkit) and
PyGObject which is
a Python package that provides bindings for GObject based libraries such as GTK, GStreamer,
WebKitGTK, GLib, GIO and many more.
Lightweight, not CPU/RAM hungry
No learning curve (easy/familiar shortcuts, easy use of plugin/extensions)
Fully customizable from A to Z (even the UI layout)
New UX approach for text editors
Easy plugin system
Made using Python for python contributors
