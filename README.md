# Gamma text editor
current version 0.0.1 Beta
Author: Hamad Al Marri


## Description 
Gamma (Î“) is a lightweight text editor. It is meant to be an alternative to Gedit or Notepad++.
Although the current implementation is tested on linux under Gnome desktop environment,
Gamma can run on Linux, Windows, and Mac if dependencies are installed
(see Dependencies section below).
Gamma uses [GTK3](https://www.gtk.org/) (cross-platform GUI toolkit) and
[PyGObject](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which is 
a Python package that provides bindings for GObject based libraries such as GTK, GStreamer,
WebKitGTK, GLib, GIO and many more.


## Why a new text editor?
-	Not cpu/ram heavy
-	No learning curve (shortcuts, difficult dealing with plugin/extensions)
-	fully customizable from A to Z
-	new UX approach for text editors
-	Made using Python for plugin developers 


## Dependencies
*	GTK+3
*	Python 3
*	gobject-introspection
If you are using Linux with a Gnome desktop, you probably have those dependencies installed already. I
am not sure if the libraries are installed for other desktops such as KDE, XFCE, or MATE. But if
you have libgtk-3-0 and python3 installed, then Gamma is probably going to work.
 


## Installation
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/hamadmarri/gamma-text-editor
cd gamma-text-editor 
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```



## Gamma Philosophy
The philosophy of Gamma is to decouple all functionalities and features into seperate plugins.
It is designed in a way that every featuer is a plugin, even for some basic and core functionalities
such as open, save, and close files, they are made in a seperate plugins which located under 
`./plugins/files_manager` folder. However, these plugins (`openfile` and `savefile`) are highly coupled with
`files_manager` plugin since they are working togather. But nothing prevent you from replacing any of these 
coupled plugins with a different plugin with respect of taking care of integrating them togather with 
the new/replacement plugin. That being said, it is a special case where they are core basic plugins for 
Gamma to work as a text editor, therefore they are highly coupled with each other. For different types
of plugins such as a plugin for showing the terminal at bottom panel, or a plugin opens a tree view of 
a directory, there is no dependencies on other plugins. For developers, see 
[For Developers](#For-Developers) section.

Commands can be open file, close file, close all files, switch to file, zoom in,\
maximize window, find and replace ....\
basically any plugin exported its commands, commander will show theirs commands. 

Commander uses splay tree to store commands. It is a binary tree\
